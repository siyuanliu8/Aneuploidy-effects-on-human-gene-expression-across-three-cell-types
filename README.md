# Aneuploidy-effects-on-human-gene-expression-across-three-cell-types
## Description

Aneuploidy syndromes are collectively common and impact diverse organs – but it remains unclear if and how aneuploidy effects on gene expression vary across human tissues. Here, we systematically examine the effects of varying chromosome X, Y and 21 dosages in 3 different cell-types: lymphoblastoid cell lines, fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cell derived excitatory neurons. We detail how - for all three chromosomes – cis effects of aneuploidy (i.e., expression changes on the aneuploidic chromosome) generalize across tissues, but trans effects (expression changes off the chromosome) do not. These findings illuminate the mechanistic bases of gene dosage disorders and the ways in which we may use accessible peripheral tissues to model effects in harder to access organs like brain.
